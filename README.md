# Introduction To Agile Development
Agile is one of the world’s most widely used and recognized software development framework.

Most of the organizations have adopted it in some form or the other but there is still a long way to go in the maturity of their adoption programs.
## History of Agile
Agile was born when on one fine day when 17 people with different development methodologies background, got together to brainstorm if there was a possible alternative solution to software development which could lead to faster development time and was less documentation heavy.

At that time, software development used to happen so long that by the time projects were ready to be delivered, the business had moved ahead and the requirements had changed. Thus a project was not able to meet the business needs even if it was able to meet its defined objectives.

Thus these champions of different software engineering techniques got together and the end result of their meeting was what they called the “agile manifesto’.

But the agile that was born that day is not what we see today in organizations. The methodology those experts agreed upon was described as ‘lightweight’ and fast. But the main win out of this meeting was the thought that faster delivery of a product and constant feedback were the keys to achieve success in software development.

The existing waterfall techniques were too cumbersome and had no provision for feedback until the final product was ready to be delivered. This meant that there was no scope for course correction and the customer had no view on the progress until the whole product was ready. And that was what these experts wanted to avoid.

They wanted a solution which would have scope for constant feedback in order to avoid the cost of rework at a later stage.
## Agile Challenges
The existing waterfall techniques at that time were too cumbersome and had no provision for feedback until the final product was ready to be delivered. It was called a waterfall model of development because the teams first finished one step completely and only after that they moved ahead to the next step.

This meant that there was no scope for course correction and the customer had no view on the progress until the whole product was ready. And that was what these experts wanted to avoid. They wanted a solution which would have scope for constant feedback in order to avoid the cost of rework at a later stage.

And that is why agile is also about being adaptive and continuous improvement, as much as it is about constant feedback and speed of delivery.

## What are Agile Promises?
![Agile-Promises](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63476270/178541017-e5b350bb-9164-4f92-9472-6336f04585ea.png)

Agile is not only about applying the set practices in developing software. It also brings in a change in the Team’s mindset which drives them towards building better software, working together and eventually landing them a happy Customer.

Agile values and principles enable the team to shift their focus and change their thought process of building better software.
## What Exactly is Agile?
Agile is not a set of rules. Agile is not a set of guidelines. Agile is not even a methodology. Rather, Agile is a set of principles that encourage flexibility, adaptability, communication and working software over plans and processes. It is very succinctly captured in what is called the agile manifesto.

Agile software development allows the team to work together more efficiently and effectively in developing complex projects. It consists of practices that exercise iterative and incremental techniques which are easily adopted and display great results.

**Agile is a software development approach where a self-sufficient and cross-functional team works on making continuous deliveries through iterations and evolves throughout the process by gathering feedback from the end users.**
## How to Practice Agile?
There are various Agile Methodologies that are in practice in various diversified industries.

![intro-to-agile](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63476270/178541581-311a38f1-55af-4371-a89d-1315d699dae8.png)

**However, the most popular methodologies amongst all of them are:**
- Scrum
- Kanban
- Extreme Programming

All these methodologies focus on lean software development and help in building better software effectively and efficiently.
# Agile Methodology
## Introduction to Agile Models
As we all know, Agile is a software development methodology.

We have also learned about the values and principles which were mentioned in the agile manifesto by the founders of agile. In our initial discussions, we also skirted upon the differences between agile and the traditional waterfall models.

You will also be able to appreciate the difference and also the advantages/disadvantages of these methodologies.
## Advantages of Agile Methodology
- The customers continuously get a look and feel of the project progress at the end of each iteration/sprint.
- Each sprint provides the customer with a working software which meets their expectations as per the definition of done provided by them.
- The development teams are quite responsive to the changing requirements and can accommodate changes even in the advanced stages of development.
- There is constant two-way communication which keeps the customers involved, thus all stakeholders – business and technical – have clear visibility on the project’s progress.
- The design of the product is efficient and fulfills the business requirements.

## Disadvantages of Agile Methodology
Though there are several advantages of Agile methodology, there are certain disadvantages involved in it too.

They are:

- Comprehensive documentation is not preferred which can lead to agile teams incorrectly interpreting this as agile doesn’t require documentation. So the rigor gets lost on documentation. This should be avoided by continuously asking yourself if this is sufficient information to proceed or not.

- Sometimes, at the beginning of the projects, the requirements are not crystal clear. The teams might proceed and find that the customers’ vision got realigned and in such situations, the teams need to incorporate many changes and it is difficult to gauge the end result as well.

## Types of Agile Methodologies
There are several agile methodologies in practice across the world. I will focus on one of the most popular methodologies is **Scrum**

![types](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63476270/178545834-412b3442-4fe0-4074-8c4b-98402dc3de80.png)
 ### Scrum
Scrum can easily be considered to be the most popular agile framework. The term ‘scrum’ is much considered synonymously to ‘agile’ by most practitioners. But that is a misconception. Scrum is just one of the frameworks by which you can implement agile.

The word scrum comes from sports rugby. Where the players huddle together in an interlocked position pushing against the opponents. Each player has a defined role in their position and can play both offensive and defensive as per the demand of the situation.

Similarly, the scrum in IT believes in empowered self-managed development teams with three specific and clearly defined roles. These roles include – **Product Owner (PO), Scrum Master (SM) and the development team consisting of the programmers and testers.** They work together in iterative time boxed durations called sprints.

The first step is the creation of the product backlog by the PO. It’s a to-do list of stuff to be done by the scrum team. Then the scrum team selects the top priority items and tries to finish them within the time box called a sprint.

An easier way to remember all of this is to memorize the 3-3-5 framework. It means that a scrum project has 3 roles, 3 artifacts, and 5 events.

**These are –**

- **Roles:** PO, Scrum master, and development team.
- **Artifacts:** Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog and Product increment.
- **Events:** Sprint, Sprint planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint review and Sprint retrospective.

![3-3-5-framework](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63476270/178546366-95022c2c-db1c-40aa-897b-19bb1c6cd84d.png)

## Scrum Methodology
SCRUM is a process in agile methodology which is a combination of the Iterative model and the incremental model.

One of the major handicaps of the traditional Waterfall model was that – until the first phase is complete, the application does not move to the other phase. And by chance, if there are some changes in the later stage of the cycle, then it becomes very challenging to implement those changes, as it would involve revisiting the earlier phases and redoing the changes.

### Some of the key characteristics of SCRUM include:

- Self-organized and focused team.
- No huge requirement documents, rather have a very precise and to the point stories.
- The cross-functional teams work together as a single unit.
- Close communication with the user representative to understand the features.
- Has a definite timeline of maximum one month.
- Instead of doing the entire “thing” at a time, Scrum does a little of everything at a given interval.
- Resources capability and availability are considered before committing anything.

To understand this methodology well, it’s important to understand the key terminologies in SCRUM.
## Important SCRUM Terminologies
### Scrum Team
The scrum team is a team comprising of 7 with + or – two members. These members are a mixture of competencies and comprise of developers, testers, database people, support people etc. along with the product owner and a scrum master.

All these members work together in close collaboration for a recursive and definite interval, to develop and implement the said features. SCRUM team sitting arrangement plays a very important role in their interaction, they never sit in cubicles or cabins, but a huge table.
### Sprint
Sprint is a predefined interval or time frame in which the work has to be completed and make it ready for review or ready for production deployment. This time box usually lies between 2 weeks to 1 month.

In our day to day life when we say that we follow 1-month Sprint cycle, it simply means that we work for one month on the tasks and make it ready for review by the end of that month.
### Product Owner
The product owner is the key stakeholder or the lead user of the application to be developed. The product owner is the person who represents the customer side. He/she has the final authority and should always be available for the team.

He/she should be reachable when anyone has any doubts that need clarification. It is important for the product owner to understand and not to assign any new requirement in the middle of the sprint or when the sprint has already started.
### Scrum Master
Scrum Master is the facilitator of the scrum team. He/she makes sure that the scrum team is productive and progressive. In case of any impediments, scrum master follows up and resolves them for the team. SCRUM Master is the mediator between the PO and the team.

He/she keeps the PO informed about the progress of the Sprint. If there are any roadblocks or concerns for the team, discusses with the PO and gets them resolved. Like the team’s Daily Standup, a standup of the SCRUM Master with the PO happens every day.
### Business Analyst (BA)
A Business Analyst plays a very important role in SCRUM. This person is responsible for getting the requirement finalized and drafted in the requirement docs (based on which the user stories are created).

If there are any ambiguities in the User Stories / Acceptance criteria, he/she is the one who is approached by the technical (SCRUM) team and he then takes it up to the PO or else if possible resolves on his own. In large scale projects, there may be more than 1 BA but in small-scale projects, the SCRUM Master may be acting as the BA as well.

It is always a good practice to have a BA when the project kick starts.
### User Story
User stories are nothing but the requirements or feature which has to be implemented.

In the scrum, we don’t have those huge requirements documents, rather the requirements are defined in a single paragraph, typically having the format as:

As a <User / type of user>
I want to <Some achievable goal/target>
To achieve <some result or reason for doing the thing>

**For Example:**

As an Admin I want to have a password lock in case the user enters an incorrect password for 3 consecutive times to restrict unauthorized access.

There are some characteristics of user stories which should be adhered. The user stories should be short, realistic, could be estimated, complete, negotiable and testable. A user story is never altered or changed in the middle of the Sprint.

It is the responsibility of the SCRUM Master and the BA (if applicable) to make sure that the PO has drafted the User Stories correctly with a proper set of the Acceptance Criteria”. If any changes which will impact the sprint release are to be made, then such stories are pulled out of the sprint or they are done as per the hours available.

Every user story has an acceptance criterion which should be well defined and understood by the team.

Acceptance criteria details down the user story that provide the supporting documents. It helps to further refine the user story. Anybody from the team can write down the acceptance criteria. Testing team bases their test cases/conditions on these acceptance criteria.
### Epics

Epics are equivocal user stories or we can say that these are the user stories which are not defined and are kept for future sprints.

Just try to relate it with life, imagine you are going for a vacation. As you are going next week, you have everything in place like your hotel bookings, sightseeing, travelers check, etc. But what about your vacation plan for next year? You only have a vague idea that you may go to XYZ place, but you have no detailed plan.

An Epic is just like you next year’s vacation plan, where you just know that you may want to go, but where, when, with whom, all these details you have no idea at this point of time.

In a similar way, there are features which are required to be implemented in the future whose details are not yet known. Mostly a feature begins with an Epic and then is broken down to stories which could be implemented.
### Product Backlog

The product backlog is a kind of bucket or source where all the user stories are kept. This is maintained by the Product Owner. The product backlog can be imagined as a wishlist of the product owner who prioritizes it as per the business needs.

During the planning meeting (see next section), one user story is taken from the product backlog, then the team does the brainstorming, understands it and refines it and collectively decides which user stories to take, with the intervention of the product owner.
### Sprint Backlog

Based on the priority, user stories are taken from the Product Backlog as one at a time. The Scrum team brainstorms on it determines the feasibility and decides on the stories to work on a particular sprint. The collective list of all the user stories which the scrum team works on a particular sprint is known as Sprint backlog.

![Sprint-Backlog](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63476270/178574956-1bbff754-78c6-4d29-9e32-fb800c153ecb.jpg)

### Story Points

Story points are a quantitative indication of the complexity of a user story. Based on the story point, estimation and efforts for a story are determined.

A story point is relative and not absolute. In order to make sure that our estimate and efforts are correct, it’s important to check that the user stories are not big. The more precise and smaller is the user story, the more accurate will be the estimation.

Each and every user story is assigned to a story point based on the Fibonacci series (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13&21). Higher is the number, the complex is the story.

**To be precise**

- If you give 1 / 2 / 3 story point it means that the story is small and of low complexity.
- If you give points as 5 / 8, it is a medium complex and
- 13 and 21 are highly complex.

Here complexity consists of both development plus testing effort.

To decide a story point, brainstorming happens within the scrum team and the team collectively decides a story point.

It may happen that the development team gives a story point of 3 to a particular story, because for them it may be 3 lines of code change, but the testing team gives 8 story point because they feel that this code change will affect larger modules so the testing effort would be larger. Whatever story point you are giving, you have to justify it.

So in this situation, brainstorming happens and the team collectively agrees to one story point.

**Whenever you are deciding on a story point, keep the below factors in mind:**

- The dependency of the story with other application/module.
- The skill-set of the resource.
- The complexity of the story.
- Historical learning.
- Acceptance criteria of the user story.

If you are not aware of a particular story, don’t size it.

Whenever a story is = or > 8 points, it is broken down into 2 or more stories.
### Burn down chart
Burn down chart is a graph which shows the estimated v/s actual effort of the scrum tasks.

It is a tracking mechanism by which for a particular sprint the day to day tasks are tracked to check whether the stories are progressing towards the completion of the committed story points or not.
### Velocity
The total number of story point which a scrum team archives in a sprint, is called Velocity. The Scrum team is judged or referenced by its velocity. Having said that, it should be kept in mind that the objective here is NOT achieving the maximum story points, but to have a quality deliverable, respecting the scrum team’s comfort level.

## Activities Done in SCRUM Methodology
### Planning Meeting
A planning meeting is the starting point of Sprint. It is the meeting where the entire scrum team gathers, the SCRUM Master selects a user story based on the priority from the product backlog and the team brainstorms on it.

Based on the discussion, the scrum team decides the complexity of the story and sizes it as per the Fibonacci series. The team identifies the tasks along with the efforts (in hours) which would be done to complete the implementation of the user story.

Many a time, the planning meeting is preceded by a “Pre-Planning meeting”. It’s just like homework which the scrum team does before they sit for the formal planning meet. The team tries to write down the dependencies or other factors which they would like to discuss in the planning meeting.
### Execution of Sprint Tasks
As the name suggests, these are the actual work done by the scrum team to accomplish their task and take the user story into the “Done” state.
### Daily Standup
During the sprint cycle, every day the scrum team meets for, not more than 15 minutes (could be a stand-up call, recommended to have during the beginning of the day) and state 3 points:

- What did the team member do yesterday?
- What did the team member plan to do today?
- Any impediments (roadblocks)?

It is the Scrum master who facilitates this meeting. In case, any team member is facing any kind of difficulties, the scrum master follows up to get it resolved. In Stand ups, the board is also reviewed and in itself shows the progress of the team.

### Review Meeting
At the end of every sprint cycle, the SCRUM team meets again and demonstrates the implemented user stories to the product owner. The product owner may cross verify the stories as per its acceptance criteria. It’s again the responsibility of the Scrum master to preside over this meeting.

Also in the SCRUM tool, the Sprint is closed and the tasks are marked done.
### Retrospective Meeting
The retrospective meeting happens after the review meeting.

The SCRUM team meets, discusses & document the following points:

- What went well during the Sprint (Best practices)?
- What did not go well in the Sprint?
- Lessons learned
- Action Items.

The Scrum team should continue to follow the best practice, ignore the “not best practices” and implement the lessons learned during the consequent sprints. The retrospective meeting helps to implement the continuous improvement of the SCRUM process

Coming to its applicability to QA teams, it is widely used for Bug tracking, Tracking project-level issues- like documentation completion and for tracking environmental issues. Working knowledge of this tool is highly desirable across the industry.
## Basics Of JIRA Tool
JIRA in its entirety is based on 3 concepts.

![Atlassian-JIRA](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63476270/178586693-232dd70c-075c-4626-9266-51bffa5f47d1.jpg)

- **Issue:** Every task, bug, enhancement request; basically anything to be created and tracked is considered an Issue.
- **Project:** A collection of issues
- **Workflow:** A workflow is simply the series of steps an issue goes through starting from creation to completion.

Say the issue first gets created, goes to being worked on and when complete gets closed. **The workflow in this case is:**
